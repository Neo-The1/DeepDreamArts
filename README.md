# NeuralStyleTransfer
- Generates stunning art by combining a style and content image!
- Currently we are using standard algorithm from  Gatys, Leon A.; Ecker, Alexander S.; Bethge, Matthias (26 August 2015). "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style". arXiv:1508.06576
- This algorithm is great! But several others have been proposed over the time. Some render better facial features. Some take much less time and computing power.
- In this project, we aim to explore various ways of generating art with neural style transfer.
